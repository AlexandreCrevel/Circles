# Circles

## Synopsis :

Circles is a social network about circles. Circles of family, friends or roommates, for example. We had many ideas, but we concentrated on the most important for us ; calendar and chat. We got plenty of ideas for the future. Feel free to try it out (it is currently in frech).

Made with React, there is the final project doing during my courses in the O'clock school. The project was done with :

## 3 front-end developers :

- [Alexandre Crevel](https://github.com/AlexandreCrevel)
- [Elodie Bustin](https://github.com/ElodieBustin)
- [Logan Willaumez](https://github.com/LoganWillaumez)

## 2 back-end developers :

- [Robin Poppel](https://github.com/robinho54)
- [Mathieu Tourte](https://github.com/AtomicMathO)

We've got 1 month to do this project. 1 week to build the infrastructure, MCD and MLD and 2,5 weeks for coding it.

Thanks a lot to my team, it was absolutely amazing to work with them. Feel free to check their profile, they merit it.
